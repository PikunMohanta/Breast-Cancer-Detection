# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Breast cancer is a common type of cancer that impacts many women around the world. Finding and diagnosing it early can help increase the likelihood of effective treatment and positive patient results. Data analysis and machine learning methods can help with breast cancer screening, offering useful information to healthcare experts.

## Objective:
This project aims to develop a breast cancer detection model using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various features and characteristics of breast mass lesions, such as size, texture, and shape, we aim to build a model that can effectively classify breast masses as malignant or benign.

## Data Collection:
[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## Models:
* Different types of models are used such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XG Boost.
* The best-performing models are Support Vector Machine(SVM) & XGBoost.
* Conclusions are made using the confusion matrix and Cross-Validation.
